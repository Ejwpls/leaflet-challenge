# leaflet-challenge

Ever wondered where earthquake occurs weekly, well you can. 
Using Javascript and leaflet we have marked in an interactive map where earthquake have occur. 
Depending on the magnitude, the colour and size of circle markers varies. From Green(low) to red(high). 

Only step 1 was completed.
